Manditory (required for next release):
- Replace raccoon sound effect
- Add links to art & sound assets

Priority:
- Show keyboard for "main" category
- Embed free fonts (partially implemented, works on Windows only)
- Embed toolbar images in executable (XPM is good choice)
- Don't reload sounds if already cached
- Re-record "xun" vocal sound
- PNG & SVG jars are different colors
- Normalize file & directory paths
- Set category items dynamically from image filenames
- Add Debian build instructions
- Build:
  - Use CMake to generate Makefiles
  - Require wxWidgets version >= 3.1 (to support font resources)
    - Use built-in static version if requirement not met
  - Only link dynamically to built-in SDL on Windows platform
    - Check for licensing issues with statically linked SDL/SDL_mixer
  - Copy library (dll) dependencies into binary release if possible on Windows platform
  - Use "libraries/build.sh" script to build & link to "built-in" libraries
  - Download "built-in" libraries from "libraries/build.sh" script

Non-priority:
- Indent line breaks in changelog
- Add debugging symbols
- Use wxThread or std::thread (c++11) class instead of pthreads (maybe)
- Use global function for setting/getting fonts
- Possibly support any audio type playable with SDL_mixer
- Use config to determine environment (locatation of data files, etc.)
- Possibly change to this quiche SVG image: http://www.clker.com/clipart-529648.html
  - Need to confirm licensing
- Clean up quiche SVG
- Finish re-working owl SVG

Fixes & pull-requests:
- wxWidgets:
  - Add wxLogWindow methods:
    - IsShown
    - HasFocus
    - SetFocus
