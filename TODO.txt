Manditory (required for next release):
- Replace raccoon sound effect
- Add links to art & sound assets

Priority:
- Show alphabet for click/press/touch support

- Re-record "xun" vocal sound
- PNG & SVG jars are different colors
- Normalize file & directory paths
- Set category items dynamically from image filenames
- Add Debian build instructions
- Build:
  - Force use of built-in wx if min version requirement not met
    or display message about USE_BUILTIN option
- Touch up SVGs:
  - owl
  - quiche
  - yangqin

Non-priority:
- Indent line breaks in changelog
- Add debugging symbols
- Use wxThread or std::thread (c++11) class instead of pthreads (maybe)
- Use global function for setting/getting fonts
- Possibly support any audio type playable with SDL_mixer
- Use config to determine environment (locatation of data files, etc.)
- Possibly change to this quiche SVG image: http://www.clker.com/clipart-529648.html
  - Need to confirm licensing
- Finish re-working owl SVG

Fixes & pull-requests:
